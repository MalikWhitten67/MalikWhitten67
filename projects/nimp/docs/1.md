<h1>Packages</h1>

<p>Packages expand nimp, just like many other languages packages are used for not only to make code clean but modular</p>

<p>For Instance Nimp utils, is a package that compiles  code to the client. like text from attributes are compiled to innerText attributes help keep code clean without the need of nesting elements.</p>


<p>Example of the use of packages:</p>


```html
 <nimp-import package="utils">
````

<p>How nimp understands to print text is if the package utils is called, if it is not then any text inside of utils-text will not be rendered</p>


<h1>Creating Packages</h1>

<p> Custom packages are like templates you can fill it with custom nimp code </p>


```html

````
